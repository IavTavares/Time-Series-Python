In this folder I'll keep my notes on how to do Time Series Analysis with Python.

The notes we'll freely follow these references:
+ Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos

+ STAT 510 - Applied Time Series Analysis from Penn State University

+ Pratical Time Series Analysis by Aileen Nielsen
