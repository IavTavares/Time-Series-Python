In this folder I'll keep my notes on how to do Time Series Analysis with Python.

The notes will freely follow these references:
+ Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos

+ STAT 510 - Applied Time Series Analysis from Penn State University

For the Multivariate Notebook, I used the the following data series from FRED Database:
+ [Real GDP per Capita](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA)
+ [Unemployment Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)
